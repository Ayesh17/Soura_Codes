# Meta-Learning 
It has been proposed and investigated in recent years in hyperparameter and parameter selection. In this approach, the choice of hyper-parameters for a problem is based on well-succeeded hyper-parameters adopted to previous similar problems. For this, it is necessary to maintain a set of meta-examples where each meta-example stores: (1) a set of characteristics (called meta-features) describing a learning problem; and (2) the best configuration of hyper-parameters (among a set of candidates) empirically evaluated on the problem.A meta-learner is then used to acquire knowledge from a set of such meta-examples in order to recommend (predict) adequate configurations of parameters for new problems based on their meta-features. Meta-learning is able to predict not only one configuration of parameters but also to recommend rankings of configurations. This is interesting since the user has more alternatives if the first configuration recommended by meta-learning does not achieve adequate results. Compared to the search approach, meta-learning tends to be more efficient in terms of computational cost.
