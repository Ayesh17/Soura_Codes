## Convolution Neural Networks and Transfer Learning features based model:  
Recently image classification task using Convolution Neural Networks (pre-trained on ImageNet dataset) and Transfer Learning has gained huge success .So, to solve the image orientation classification problem (front, side and back view) three pre-trained Convolution Neural Network model features have been extracted. The three models are **Mobile net** , **VGG16** and **Inception** from which the last layer features have been extracted which consists of the most important and specific features for the classification task. Each of the pre-trained features has been finally trained on our dataset. The pre-trained features act as the predictors and all the 5 models mentioned previously which consists of **SVM, Multinomial Logistic, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest** with the response variable having 3 classesâ€™ i.e. Front view, Side view and Back view.
