# Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian optimization has proven to be a very efficient black-box optimization technique in the recent times and is being used in the applications of tuning hyper-parameters.
Bayesian Optimization being the most efficient amongst the three mentioned above, implements gaussian prior and then combines the likelihood of the data to obtain the posterior, and then based on an acquisition function, it searches for the next point in the space. Through gaussian process, it forms a prior for the function with the mean and variance and with the help of the data /the likelihood is computed and both combined to give the posterior distribution of the functions. Once the distribution and the confidence interval are computed, the next point is searched in the space where there are current optimal point and in points where there is high variance. Optimizing both the factors, an acquisition function is constructed and maximized using several techniques (Expected improvement is used in this case) to find the next optimally best point.
