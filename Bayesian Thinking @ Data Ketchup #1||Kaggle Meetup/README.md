### Bayesian Thinking & Estimating Posterior Distribution for Linear Regression @ Data Ketchup #1||Kaggle Meetup

One of the major motivations of this research is the fact that there has been an increasing focus on Deep model interpretability with the advent of more and more complex models. More is the complexity of the model, difficult it gets to have interpretability with respect to the outputs and a lot of research is going in the field of Bayesian thinking and learning. But before understanding and being able to appreciate Bayesian in deep neural models, we should be well versed and adept with Bayesian thinking in linear models for example- Bayesian Linear regression.But there are very few good materials available online in a combined fashion which can give a clear motivation and understanding of the Bayesian Linear regression.
This was one of the major motivations for this talk and I have tried to give an understanding of how to approach the Linear regression from a Bayesian analysis standpoint.

I have written a blog as well : [Bayesian Thinking](https://medium.com/@souradip_chak/bayesian-thinking-estimating-posterior-distribution-for-linear-regression-data-ketchup-2f50a597eb06)

P.S â€” I am still adding certain materials to the blog before I publish it officially. I will add a bit more details to MLE as participants were not completely comfortable with that and also show an use-case that was asked in the talk. So, keep following.

There were a few articles and blogs on the same but the mathematical aspects of Bayesian were not very clearly mentioned which was a point of focus for this blog.
